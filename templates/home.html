                <p>The authors of this report predict that causal inference will continue to be a major research imperative of Artificial Intelligence. In many cases, we are interested in knowing the causal risk factors of a chosen target. For examples, in medicine, we would be interested in knowing the causal risk factors for breast cancer metastasis; In biomedicine, we would be interested in knowing the genetic risk factors that are directly responsible for Alzheimerâ€™s disease; in clinical practice, we would be interested in knowing the treatment effect of a new drug on a particular disease. Note that cause and causal effect (the treatment effect in my occasions) go side by side. We have many existing machine learning methods that can help learn associations/correlations/dependencies between some factors and a chosen target, which is often called a class feature in machine learning, but those factors are not causal and may not have a causal influence on the chosen target. Learning the causal factors of a chosen target from data is a state-of-the-art approach for understanding the causal mechanisms, helping improve personalized prediction of the chosen target and conduct intervention efficiently and effectively.

                    In this category of our iMedCausal, we are currently including four methods for learning causal factors to a chosen target, while in the meantime we will continue to develop new methods on our own and search for other existing methods, to be included. The current three methods consists of

        <!-- <ul>MBIL - This is the MBIL version of java which uses Markov Blanket and Interactive factor learning in order to determine the direct causes for the chosen variable.</ul>-->
        <ul>iRCT - This is the most up-to-date version of iRCT which uses propensity scores based off of all covariates in order to do matching and then calculates the average treatment effect using these matches.</ul>
        <ul>Multi-covariate iterative iRCT - This method uses an iterative process to slowly work through all the data selecting the best match based on propensity scores calcualted via all covariates. This method may take a while due to the iterative nature. Best to use on small datasets.</ul>
        <ul>Single-covariate iRCT - This is the most basic form of iRCT allowing you to select a treatment, outcome, and the single covariate to match on. This method may take a while due to the iterative nature. Best to use on small datasets.</ul>
